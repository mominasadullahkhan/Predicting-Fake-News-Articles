# Predicting Fake News Articles - Capstone 2
-------- 
Hi!

My name is Momin Khan and this is my repo for my second capstone project: Predicting Fake News Articles on a Social Media Platform.

I completed a number of projects as part of the Springboard Data Science Track.

For this project I performed natural language processing and implemented a predictive model for the social media company utilizing a Logistic Regression model to classify fake news and reduce misinformation on the platform.  I attained 95% AUC-ROC & demonstrated value of text analysis and implementing machine learning as well as Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks in an effort to flag and reduce fake news articles on the platform. 

To find out more about this project, check out the attached presentation below!
